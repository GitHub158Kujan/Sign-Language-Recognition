# Sign Language Recognition Project

This project is a sign language recognition system implemented in Python. It utilizes various libraries and frameworks including TensorFlow, OpenCV, MediaPipe, and Keras.

## Overview

Sign language recognition is an important application of computer vision and machine learning, aimed at helping individuals with hearing impairments communicate more effectively. This project aims to build a system that can recognize hand signs representing different letters or words in sign language.

## Features

- **Real-time Hand Tracking**: Utilizes OpenCV and MediaPipe to detect and track hand gestures in real-time.
- **Gesture Classification**: Uses TensorFlow and Keras to classify hand gestures into corresponding letters or words.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Provides a simple and intuitive interface for users to interact with the system.
